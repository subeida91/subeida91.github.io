  <section><h1>About me:</h1>
  <p> 
    I'm a mixed-methods user researcher. My work involves carrying out user studies to inform the development of existing and future products. I have a background in Psychology and a masters in human-computer interaction and design, having obtained my degrees at City University, London. I have worked as a Freelancer, a Student Contractor with Microsoft in Cambridge, as a Research associate at City University with their partners Fujitsu, and a start up called Catapult. I have also interned at a neurosicence lab at City University which was funded by a busary I received from the Experimental Psychology Society. I have a <a href="https://blog.subeidaahmed.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> where I  write about my work and the social and cognitive aspects of computer use. </p>
