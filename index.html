  <section><h1>About me:</h1>
  <p> 
    I'm a mixed-methods researcher. My work involves carrying out user studies to inform the development of existing and future products. I have a background in Psychology and a masters in human-computer interaction and design, having obtained my degrees at City University, London. I have worked as a Freelancer, a student contractor with Microsoft in Cambridge, and as a research associate at City University with their partners Fujitsu, and a start up called Catapult. I also  worked as an neurosicence intern at City University which was funded by a busary I received from the Experimental psychology study. I write on my blog about the social and cognitive aspects of computer use, with an eye to the design of new or improvement of technologies. </p>
