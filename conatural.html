    <h1>Heuristic evaluation of CoNatural</h1>

    
    <h3>Background</h3>
  <p> 
    As part of a review before a redesign of their website I was asked by the owner of the E-commerce to investigate the usability of their website and offer suggestions on how to improve the experience for their users. I ran a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. A detailed blog post about the findings of the study can be found here:  </p>
  </section>

  <section><h3>Process</h3>
    <p> 
       <ul>
           <li>I selected the pages that the users would have to travel through to complete an order as this was the key user journey of the website. </li>
           <li>I then stepped through those screens and that interaction, applying the heuristics to find potential problems. </li>
           <li>I wrote down all the violations of the heuristics that I came across, no matter how big or small they were.</li>
           <li>I then rated the severity of each violation I came across. This was a four-point rating scale, ranging from one, which represents a cosmetic problem, no real usability impact, so something that's maybe just annoying, to four, which is a usability catastrophe, absolutely imperative to fix, because users will not be able to make successful use of the system if that problem isn't fixed. </li>
           <li>I created a presentation, prioritising the most important problems that need to be fixed. The report included a link to view all 54 problems found on the website along with screenshots to indicate precisely where in the interface this problem occurs. </li>
           <li>I also included an explanation of the heuristics to explain why they matter. This helped me communicate to the stakeholder about not only what the problems are, but why they're a problem and why it might be important to fix them.  </li>
           <li>Finally, a recommendation was offered about how this might be fixed.</li>

        </ul> 
    </section>


  <section><h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p> 
       <ul>
           <li>The results of the evaluation would have been better if I had multiple eyes looking at the same thing rather than just having one person do it. Research on heuristic evaluation has shown that, on average, one evaluator will find about 35 percent or a third of the true problems that would be found with a full-fledged usability test.</li>
           <li>User testing would have allowed me to measure other qualities beyond usability such as desirability, usefulness and the impressions the users had of the site. However, the budget was not available for this. </li>
        </ul> 
    </section>

    <section><h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p> 
         <ul>
             <li>Although done alone, the heuristic evaluation was a cheap and quick method to use which found many problems potential users may have faced when using the site. </li>
